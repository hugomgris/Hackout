# Hackout
Recreation of the hacking minigame in Fallout games, written in C

Extract, run "make game" from extracton directory, enjoy.

Difficulty levels (1-3) affect the length of the password to search. If selected word is incorrect, similarity value will return the amount of correct letters in correct places inside the selected words. 

This is a work in progress, just an alpha 0.1 build. Future builds will try to have a cleaner, more optimized code (without leaks, lol), intro and outro screens and several more implementations.

If you find a bug, have any commentary or want to share a cool idea to add to the funcionality of the current build, feel free to contact me (here or through any of the possible contact links in the url you can find in my bio).

Thanks for playing <3
