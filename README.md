```t video game series. Test your pattern recognition skills by finding the correct password hidden among random gibberish in a retro computer terminal interface.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

Hackout simulates a ROBCO Industries terminal where you must crack a password by selecting the correct word from a grid of random characters. The game features three difficulty levels with increasing word lengths and complexity.

### Features

- **3 Difficulty Levels**: Choose from 4, 5, or 6-letter words
- **Retro Terminal Aesthetics**: Green monospace text with typewriter effect
- **Password Similarity Feedback**: Get hints about how close your guess was
- **Limited Attempts**: 4 attempts before lockout
- **Random Word Pool**: Hundreds of words across all difficulty levels

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Make utility
- Linux/Unix environment with terminal support

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hackerout-0.1.git
   cd Hackerout-0.1
   ```

2. **Compile and run**
   ```bash
   make game
   ```

   Or compile manually:
   ```bash
   make
   ./hackerout play
   ```

3. **Start the game**
   ```bash
   ./hackerout play
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose access level 1-3
   - Level 1: 4-letter words
   - Level 2: 5-letter words  
   - Level 3: 6-letter words

2. **Analyze the Terminal**: Look for actual words hidden among random symbols in the hexadecimal dump-style display

3. **Enter Your Guess**: Type the word you think is the password

4. **Use Feedback**: The game shows similarity score (number of correct letters in correct positions)

5. **Win or Lose**: 
   - Success: "PASSWORD ACCEPTED. ACCESS GRANTED."
   - Failure: "TOO MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS. INTRUDER DETECTED."

## Technical Details

### Core Components

- **Builder Module**: Creates randomized terminal display with hex addresses and symbols
- **Injector Module**: Strategically places real words within the gibberish
- **Manager Module**: Handles game state, input validation, and similarity checking
- **Printer Module**: Provides retro terminal aesthetics with green text and typewriter effects

### Word Lists

- **Level 1**: 101 four-letter words (ABLE, ACID, AIDE...)
- **Level 2**: 123 five-letter words (ABOUT, ACORN, ACTOR...)
- **Level 3**: 131 six-letter words (ABANDON, ABDUCT, ABJURE...)

### Display Format

The game generates a hex dump-style display:
```
0x1234  &#@$WORD%^&*  0x5678  !@#$%^&*()
0x9ABC  *()_+PASS=[]  0xDEFG  {}|:"<>?
```

Real words are hidden among the random symbols in designated injection zones.

## Inspiration

This game is inspired by the terminal hacking minigames from the *Fallout* series by Bethesda Game Studios. It recreates the tense atmosphere of cracking into abandoned computer terminals in a post-apocalyptic world.
